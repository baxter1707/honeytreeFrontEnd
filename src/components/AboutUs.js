          The Honey Tree grew out of a passion for bees, beekeeping, and honey. Created in 2012, in the small town of Powder Springs, Georgia, Ray Baxter began his journey in the world of bees and honey. Inspired by a good friend of his, Ray found the process to be relaxing and fascinating. Our products are created by nature and in a manner that contributes positively to the world around us. We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy bringing them to you.
